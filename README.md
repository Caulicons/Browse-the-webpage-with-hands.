## Acquired knowledge

- ✅ Learn that a can I use machine learning with javascript using libs google like, [TensoFlow.JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
- ✅ Use [Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker), to run heavy code logic in the background without crashing the screen. Heavy code logic like machine learning on web, recognize hands and blinks in real time. 
- ✅ Use pre-trained models from Google to detection things like hands and face.
